# Ray Tracer Development Log

## Project Overview
A simple ray tracer built in C++ to learn about ray tracing techniques and graphics programming.

## Current Features
- Basic ray tracing implementation
- Sphere rendering
- WASD camera movement
- Real-time FPS counter
- OpenGL-based display

## Devlog 1
So far I have a basic ray tracer that can render spheres. You can move the camera around with WASD and the FPS counter is displayed in the window title. I think the next step is to add a light source and render a more complex scene.
